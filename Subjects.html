                <h2>Astronomy</h2>
                Astronomy is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School
                of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is the branch of magic and
                science that studies stars and the movement of planets. Students
                use their wands with an Orrery to predict the next eclipse, the
                only known practical form of magic used in the class. Astronomy
                lessons are spent learning the names of stars and the movements
                of planets. It is a required class from year one until year
                five, and becomes an optional subject for the final two years.
              </div>

              <div id="Charms">
                <h2>Charms</h2>
                Charms is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School of
                Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unsurprisingly, it specializes in the
                teaching of charms. Even though mastering charm-work is clearly
                essential to performing the greater part of magic, charm-work is
                seen as a "softer option" by some. Charms is a required subject
                for all students in their first five years at Hogwarts School of
                Witchcraft and Wizardry. The spells learned in Charms class are
                taken from textbooks. Students are taught specific wand
                movements and proper pronunciation. Often, students partner up
                in class to experiment on one another.

              <div id="DADA">
                <h2>Defense against the Dark Arts</h2>
                Defence Against the Dark Arts (abbreviated as DADA) is a subject
                taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and
                Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class,
                students study and learn how to defend themselves against all
                aspects of the Dark Arts, including dark creatures, curses,
                hexes and jinxes (dark charms), and dueling. Defence Against the
                Dark Arts is a required subject from first year to fifth year.
                The curriculum of the class varies greatly depending on what the
                professor at the time deems appropriate.

              <div id="Flying">
                <h2>Flying</h2>
                Flying, also known as Broom Flight Class, is a subject taught at
                Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is taught by
                Madam Rolanda Hooch, the Hogwarts Flying Instructor and
                Quidditch referee. The subject teaches students how to fly
                broomsticks. The course aims of these lessons are largely aimed
                towards providing students with a basic understanding of the
                only the most elementary principles behind the study of
                broomology, which is to say, both how to handle a broom and
                progressively work on various techniques and maneuvers performed
                while in flight, as well as receiving proper instructions on the
                subject of proper broom care and maintenance.
              </div>
              <div id="Herbology">
                <h2>Herbology</h2>
                Herbology is the study of magical and mundane plants and fungi,
                making it the wizarding equivalent to botany. Herbology is a
                core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
                and Wizardry. In this class, students learn to care for and
                utilize plants, learn about their magical properties and what
                they are used for. Many plants provide ingredients for potions
                and medicine, while others have magical effects of their own
                right. Herbology is a mandatory class at Hogwarts for the first
                five years of a student's education. Students spend class time
                learning about the different varieties of magical plants that
                exist. The further into a student's education, the more
                difficult and dangerous the plants become.

              <div id="HoM">
                <h2>History of Magic</h2>
                History of Magic is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts
                School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The class involves studying
                magical history and doesn't require the use of magic. From the
                first year to the fifth, students learn about the 'History of
                Wizards and the Magical World,' with a focus on remembering
                dates, names, and events. The class is completed with an O.W.L.
                exam that only has a written section.
              </div>
              <div id="Potions">
                <h2>Potions</h2>
                Potions is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School of
                Witchcraft and Wizardry. In this class, students learn how to
                brew potions using specific recipes and various magical
                ingredients, starting with simple ones and progressing to more
                advanced ones. Potions is a required subject for students from
                the first year to the fifth year. While potion recipes can be
                found in books, the intricacies of timing, ageing, stirring
                techniques, and bottling are more difficult to learn without the
                guidance of experienced masters.
              </div>
              <div id="Transfiguration">
                <h2>Transfiguration</h2>
                Transfiguration is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts
                School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It involves learning the art
                of changing the form and appearance of an object or person,
                commonly known as "Transfiguration." The magic is considered
                complex and dangerous, with limits governed by Gamp's Law of
                Elemental Transfiguration. There are many branches of
                Transfiguration, including Trans-Species Transformation and
                Human Transfiguration. It's regarded as "very hard work" and
                "more scientific" than charms-work. Transfiguration is required
                for all first-year to fifth-year students, with an option for a
                N.E.W.T. course in the sixth and seventh year.
